               <h2>Talks between Georginio Wijnaldum and Liverpool
                  over a new contract have reached a stalemate.</h2>
               <p class="first-paragraph">
                  Sky Sports News has been told suggestions that
                  Wijnaldum has turned down a
                  new contract offer from Liverpool are wide of the
                  mark.
                  The player, who is out of contract in the summer,
                  wants to stay at Anfield
                  but believes his wages should compare more
                  favourably with the club's top earners.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman remains keen to sign
                  his compatriot but, as of yet, that interest has
                  not progressed into an official offer from the
                  Spanish giants to either the player or Liverpool.
                  A difficult start to the LaLiga season, as well as
                  their ongoing presidential elections, has
                  put any potential transfer business on hold, while
                  Koeman's future at the club looks far from secure.

               <h2>Amiri, Zara Settle $3 Million Lawsuit Over
                  Lookalike Biker Jeans</h2>
               <p class="first-paragraph">
                  Zara and Amiri have settled their $3 million-plus
                  legal battle centering on a pricey pair of
                  biker-style jeans the Zara allegedly jacked from the
                  burgeoning Los Angeles-based brand. The settlement
                  comes almost a year after
                  Amiri filed suit against Zara and its parent company
                  Inditex in a federal court in California.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Arguing that the fast fashion giant was running
                  afoul of federal trademark law by
                  offering up a style of jeans bearing “obvious and
                  overwhelming similarities”
                  to its $1,150 MX2 jeans without ever “approaching
                  [Amiri] for a license to use its
                  trade dress or other of [its] intellectual property
                  rights” in connection with its staple denim
                  offering.

               <h2>You got a new iPhone 12 for the holidays — here are
                  the first things you should do</h2>
               <p class="first-paragraph">You may have received a new
                  iPhone over the holidays. Or maybe you bought one
                  for yourself.
                  If you did, there are a few tips and tricks you
                  should know about that will help you get the most
                  out of it.
               </p>
               <p>
                  A lot of these tricks are part of Apple’s latest
                  software, iOS 14, which means they don’t
                  just apply to the new iPhone 12 models. Aside from a
                  couple of tips that are specific to
                  the iPhone 12, they’ll also work on other iPhone
                  models,
                  which means you can still try these even if you have
                  an iPhone SE or an older model, like the iPhone 11.

               <h2>The key differences between yoga and Pilates</h2>
               <p class="first-paragraph">One is a holistic discipline
                  originating from ancient India,
                  the other a specific physical system devised by a
                  German anatomist
                  in the early 20th century, but there’s much
                  cross-over – and therein lies confusion – between
                  yoga and Pilates.
               </p>
               <p>
                  As practices today, yoga and Pilates are both
                  celebrated for their numerous health benefits,
                  from offering connection to the body and stress
                  relief, to developing flexibility, strength,
                  control and endurance. There are countless
                  interpretations of both disciplines
                  (and one person’s balance class is another person’s
                  cardio) but what links them both is breath work.

                  insurrection, incited by the President'</h2>
               <p class="first-paragraph">(CNN)Republican Sen. Mitt

                  the will of the voters in the presidential election,
                  lambasted President Donald Trump on Wednesday
                  for encouraging supporters
                  to disrupt the peaceful transition of power in "an
                  unprecedented attack against our democracy."

                  two months and stirred to action this very morning,
